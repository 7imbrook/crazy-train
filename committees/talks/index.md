About Talks
===========

**TechTalks** allow students from all computing disciplines to share the unique tools, technologies, and experiences that they've encountered while on co-op and in other areas outside of RIT's curriculum. Students from Software Engineering, Computer Science, Information Technology, and Computer Engineering are invited to give 30-45 minute presentations to those interested in learning a bit about a particular topic.

**RandTalks** allow students from all diciplines to share their knowledge and expertise within any field. All students are invited to give 30-45 minute presentations on any topic they wish to share with the SSE community.

The Night of **MicroTalks** takes place one night each quarter and is the perfect opportunity for anyone to share any piece of information on any subject they so desire. MicroTalks are 5-15 minute presentations where any student can feel free to talk about anything from a cool little command line tool or an awesome web service, to an interesting strategy for a game or an amazing club on campus. Giving a MicroTalk is a great way for a student to get used to presenting, and can be good practice for a bigger future TechTalk or RandTalk.

These programs enable students to expand their knowledge and allow presenters a chance to exercise and expand their presentation skills in a fun manner.
